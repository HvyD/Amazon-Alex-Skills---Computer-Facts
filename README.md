Alexa Skill.  In this project, I build a fully functional skill for [Amazonâ€™s Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) that provides year-dated facts from AI History (or some other History of your choosing).  Through the process, I got to use the [Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit) - a current state of the art API for building voice systems.
